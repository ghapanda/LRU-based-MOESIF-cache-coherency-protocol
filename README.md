# LRU-based-MOESIF-cache-coherency-protocol
The goal of this project is to learn about cache coherency and cache management in a modern multi-core system. You should design an LRU-based MOESIF cache coherency protocol for a four-core machine and report various statistics including the number of cache misses, writeback, etc.
